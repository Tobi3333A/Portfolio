                <p>
                    I am developing a computer vision-based autonomous system for drones, small test cars, and mobile robots using <strong>deep learning algorithms</strong>.

                <img src="Resources/Images/Climate Change.png" alt="Prediction Methods Comparison">
                <p>
                    In correlation with another project, I am working with different models (<strong>LSTM</strong>, <strong>GRU</strong>, and <strong>CNN</strong> for now) to predict climate change using various datasets, including some from NASA, made from real-life data. My goal is to compare these models.

                <h3>AI-Remotely Operated Climate Computing Network Systems (Ongoing)</h3>
                <img src="Resources/Images/sensors.png  " alt="Environmental Sensor System Project">
                <p>
                    I built an environmental sensor system using <strong>Arduino Uno, SCD40 Sensor,</strong> and <strong>PMSA003I Sensor</strong> to measure temperature, humidity, particle size & conctration, and the concentration of carbon dioxide gases in an environment.
                    I will be integrating more sensors to the system to measure the concentration of other greenhouse gases (ozone, sulfur dioxide, and other gases). After that, I will connect the system to a remote, so the system can be controlled from anywhere using the remote.<br>
                    I will also be using a <strong>deep neural network</strong> to make predictions based on the readings gotten from the sensors.<br>
                    Lastly, when the system is complete, I will make a website that can collect the readings from the systems to show live data-feed.

                <img src="Resources/Images/facereg.png" alt="Face Recognition">
                <p>
                    I used  multiple <strong>deep neural networks</strong> to create a facial recognition system that can detect and recognize a person's face from among a set of faces in an image, a video, or in real-time using a webcam.<br>
                    Right now, I am using multiple models to detect brain tumors from MRI scans.

                <h3>Deep Learning Classification Project</h3>
                <img src="Resources/Images/deeplearning.png" alt="Deep Learning Classification Project">
                <p>
                    As a final project for my Deep Learning course, I trained a pretrained <strong>convolutional neural network (CNN)</strong> to classify roundworms into "alive" or "dead".
                    I also tested the model's performance on a separate test set and evaluated its accuracy.
                    I used <strong>MATLAB</strong> and its Deep Learning Toolbox to implement the project.
