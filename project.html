                <p>
                    I am developing a computer vision-based autonomous system for drones, small test cars, and mobile robots using <strong>deep learning algorithms</strong>.

                <p>
                    In correlation with another project, I am working with different models (<strong>LSTM</strong>, <strong>GRU</strong>, and <strong>CNN</strong> for now) to predict climate change using various datasets, including some from NASA, made from real-life data. My goal is to compare these models.

                <p>
                    I built an environmental sensor system using <strong>Arduino Uno, SCD40 Sensor,</strong> and <strong>PMSA003I Sensor</strong> to measure temperature, humidity, particle size & conctration, and the concentration of carbon dioxide gases in an environment.
                    I will be integrating more sensors to the system to measure the concentration of other greenhouse gases (ozone, sulfur dioxide, and other gases). After that, I will connect the system to a remote, so the system can be controlled from anywhere using the remote.<br>
                    I will also be using a <strong>deep neural network</strong> to make predictions based on the readings gotten from the sensors.<br>
                    Lastly, when the system is complete, I will make a website that can collect the readings from the systems to show live data-feed.

                <p>
                    I used  multiple <strong>deep neural networks</strong> to create a facial recognition system that can detect and recognize a person's face from among a set of faces in an image, a video, or in real-time using a webcam.<br>
                    Right now, I am using multiple models to detect brain tumors from MRI scans.

                <img src="Resources/Images/ACL Picture.png" alt="ACL Injury">
                <p>
                    To help to prevent ACL injuries among atheletes, which has seen a rise, my team came together to design an <strong>IoT device (compression sleeve)</strong> that athletes can wear on their knees. This device will use <strong>IMU, pressure, and stretch sensors</strong>
                    to take readings of the movements of a user's knee. These readings would be analyzed, and various suggestions would be sent to each user's account (dashboard) on a website.
                    The readings will also be used to create a dataset that can be used for future research on ACL injuries.<br>
                    Additionally, the website inlcudes an ACL Risk Assessment to predict a user's chances of getting an ACL injury based on data entered by the user as answers to certain question. This risk checker was made using <strong>Random Forest</strong>
                    and <strong>streamlit</strong>.<br>

                <img src="Resources/Images/Thinfilm.png" alt="Thin Film Crystals">
                <p>
                    As a student researcher at Xavier University of Louisiana, I am currently working on the characterization of structural defects in single crystal and thin film materials using <strong>X-ray diffraction</strong> and other techniques.
                    The goal of this project is to understand how these defects affect the properties of the materials and to develop methods to control them.
                    I am also working on the synthesis of thin film materials (specifically, <strong>Molybdenum disulfide</strong>).<br>
                    This project is ongoing, and I am continuously learning new material synthesis techniques.

                <p>
                    As a final project for my Python programming course as a cohort member of the Morehouse Summer Bridge Experience Program,
                    I conducted an exploratory data analysis of the relationship between emergency response times, crash severity, and economic burden,
                    using a dataset compiled by MIT and containing over 10,000 records from 10 different countries.<br>

                    As part of my goal to start a free educational platform, I created this website that will be published on the web officially, soon.<br>

                <p>
                    As a final project for my Deep Learning course, I trained a pretrained <strong>convolutional neural network (CNN)</strong> to classify roundworms into "alive" or "dead".
                    I also tested the model's performance on a separate test set and evaluated its accuracy.
                    I used <strong>MATLAB</strong> and its Deep Learning Toolbox to implement the project.

                    To practice my <strong>JavaScript</strong> programming skills, I created a simple Mad Libs game that prompts the user for various words (nouns (user's name), verbs, adjectives).
                    and then generates a very simple story using those words.<br>

                <p>
                    To practice my web development skills, I decided to do an unsual project of creating a robot that can change its eye color to red, simulating a laser beam. The robot is also on a background that can change its color anytime a button is clicked.<br>
                    This was done using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>.<br>
