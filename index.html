            Hello! I'm Oluwatobiloba, preferably called Emmanuel. I'm a freshman at Xavier University of Louisiana, studying Robotics & Mechatronics Engineering with a minor in Computer Science.
            In addition to my studies, I work as a student researcher, where I am currently working on the Characterization of Structural Defects in Single crystal and Thing film materials using X-ray diffraction and other techniques.
            I am also a member of the XULA Coding contest team, where we participate in coding competitions and hackathons.
            My interests include web development, data science, machine learning, and robotics.<br><br>
            I learn quickly and am always eager to take on new challenges and expand my skill set as I do not believe in mediocrity nor do I believe in limits.
            I enjoy working with others and learning from their experiences as well. I've worked on several web development projects and am currently working on a website for my educational platform.
            On the robotics side, I have experience with Arduino and deep learning for robotics applications. I also am working on new projects for the use of Python to program microcontrollers for drones, autonomous cars, and pendulums.<br><br>
            In my free time, I enjoy watching movies (especially action movies) and soccer (I like Inter Milan). I also love to make movie edits using CapCut; hopefully, I can start my YouTube channel very soon. I also want to start going out to explore the world.<br>
            Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to collaborate on a project or just want to chat!
